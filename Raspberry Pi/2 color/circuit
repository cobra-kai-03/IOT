Circuit connections:

Connect the cathode (negative) leg of the LED_ROT (red LED) to GPIO Pin 24.
Connect the cathode (negative) leg of the LED_GRUEN (green LED) to GPIO Pin 23.
Connect the anode (positive) legs of both LEDs to a current-limiting resistor (typically around 220-470 ohms).
Connect the other end of the current-limiting resistors to the Raspberry Pi's ground (GND) pin.
