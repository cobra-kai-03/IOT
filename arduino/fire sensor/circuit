The circuit connections are as follows:

Connect the positive (longer) leg of the LED to pin 13 on the Arduino board.
Connect the negative (shorter) leg of the LED to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino board.
Connect one pin of the flame sensor to pin 8 on the Arduino board.
Connect the other pin of the flame sensor to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino board.
