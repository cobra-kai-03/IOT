The circuit connections are as follows:

Connect the positive (longer) leg of the DHT11 sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino board.
Connect the negative (shorter) leg of the DHT11 sensor to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino board.
Connect the data pin of the DHT11 sensor to pin 7 on the Arduino board.
