The circuit connections are as follows:

Connect the anode (longer leg) of the RGB LED to the 5V pin on the Arduino board.
Connect the cathode (shorter legs) of the RGB LED to the current-limiting resistors and then to the following pins on the Arduino board:
Connect the red leg of the RGB LED to pin 11 on the Arduino board.
Connect the green leg of the RGB LED to pin 10 on the Arduino board.
Connect the blue leg of the RGB LED (if available) to another pin on the Arduino board (not used in this code).
